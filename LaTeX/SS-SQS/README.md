# Overview

This is a brief placeholder for the full README that I will write later


## Instructions

1. Fill in `sqs-params.txt`.

1. Double click on `.RData` file to launch R.

1. Click up arrow to bring up last command.
  ```r
  source("lib.R")
  sqs_wrapper()
  ```

1. Build `sqs_template.tex` using `pdflatex`


Note: you can run `sqs_wrapper()` without fear of over-writing your `*.tex` file.
